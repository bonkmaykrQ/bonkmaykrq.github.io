[Midnight UI](https://github.com/Tropix126/BetterDiscordStuff/tree/fa5eece504a7f0aa92f5ec97fd9644893773355e/midnight) is a BetterDiscord and Powercord theme created by [Tropical](https://github.com/Tropix126).

Tropical has since moved on to the [Slate project](https://discordstyles.github.io/slate-theme/), accepting pull requests occasionally. Since I use this theme alot (fuck the Discord TOS) I've decided to improve Midnight voluntarily with Tropical's approval.
